  	<h1>DERRY GAMECRAFT 2013 JUDGES <small>by Vicky Twomey-Lee</h1>

	<p><h3>Mark-Philipp Hugo</h3>

<p>Mark-Philipp is the European Director for Sales Planning &amp; Strategy and Lotcheck Departments at Nintendo of Europe. Starting as Games Tester for The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (Nintendo 64) in 1998, he now is responsible for game evaluation and software strategy as well as the technical certification group. He is 38, married and father of two children.</p>

<h3>Nic Magnier</h3>

<p>Nic Magnier is a Senior Product Analyst at Nintendo of Europe where he evaluates titles in development on Wii U and Nintendo 3DS and gives feedback to developers. Before joining Nintendo in 2006, Nic worked in game development as a programmer and game designer. He got the programming bug when moving a turtle on his Thomson TO8D monitor for the first time in 1986. Over the years, as he was spending more time playing games on his Game Boy than programming, he decided that one day he will work in the games industry.</p>

<h3>Oliver Burkietowicz</h3>

<p>Oliver is a Senior Network Business Specialist at Nintendo of Europe. He started his gaming career as a Decathlon and River Raid addict at the age of five. At some point he turned pro gamer and ran a gaming news site, which eventually led to proper jobs such as a community manager or producing gaming clips for TV. After going to Uni for a second time to study Japanese, he finally joined Nintendo of Europe in 2008. At Nintendo, Oliver was responsible for planning the digital releases across their various platforms for years. Nowadays, he works on the company’s digital strategy, including Nintendo eShop and its business policies, aiming to make it a better place for all developers.</p>

<h3>Andrea Magnorsky</h3>

<p>Andrea is a professional software developer and has accrued many years of experience building applications. After a long life in the entreprise development world she is now developing games and the proud co-founder of <a href="http://batcatgames.com">BatCat Games</a>.

<h3>Dave McCabe</h3>

<p>Dave McCabe is a filmmaker, video game narrative designer and all around writer sort who has worked on more things than he’d care to remember. He’d give you a list, but it would just depress him when you’d heard of none of it. He has been playing video games since he couldn’t get past the first boss of an early 80′s version of ‘Green Beret’ that is so old he can’t even find a video for it on youtube. You can find him on twitter <a href="http://dublingamecraft.com/category/judges-2/twitter.com/davetheallthing">@davetheallthing</a> where he’ll probably say something about your ma.</p>
