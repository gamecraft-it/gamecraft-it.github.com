	<p><h2>Lewis Harvey</h2>

<p>Lewis Harvey is the <a title="Lionhead: Team Tuesday: Lewis Harvey – Assistant Producer" href="http://lionhead.com/team-tuesday-lewis-harvey-assistant-producer/">Associate Producer</a> at <a title="Lionhead Studios" href="http://lionhead.com/">Lionhead Studios</a>. “Video games have been a lifelong passion for me. I’ve been working in the industry since I was 17 working with multiple studios such as EA, THQ and Rare. I joined Lionhead in 2009 as a producer for <a title="Fable III" href="http://lionhead.com/fable-3/">Fable III</a>. It was a dream come true and a fantastic, ambitious and often crazy project. Over the years I have had the fortune of seeing Fable grow and develop as a franchise, pioneering Kinect experiences and returning to its roots with <a title="Fable: Anniversary" href="http://lionhead.com/tag/fable-anniversary/">Fable: Anniversary</a>. Now I’m responsible for expanding <a title="Lionhead Studios" href="http://lionhead.com/">Lionhead</a> beyond our huge Fable franchise and opening a new door of opportunity, getting excited about new talent and new ideas! With that in mind I can’t wait to see what GameCraft brings!” <a title="Lionhead Studios" href="http://lionhead.com">http://lionhead.com</a> / <a title="Lewis Harvey on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/LewHarvey">@LewHarvey</a></p>

<h2>Dave McCabe</h2>

<p>Dave McCabe is a filmmaker, video game narrative designer and all around writer sort who has worked on more things than he’d care to remember. He’d give you a list, but it would just depress him when you’d heard of none of it. He has been playing video games since he couldn’t get past the first boss of an early 80′s version of ‘Green Beret’ that is so old he can’t even find a video for it on youtube. You can find him on twitter <a href="http://dublingamecraft.com/category/judges-2/twitter.com/davetheallthing">@davetheallthing</a> where he’ll probably say something about your ma.</p>
